# Description

Mud 2 is an open world game where everyone does what he/she wishes. There are numerous game modes featuring different cars, airplanes and characters.
In Mud 2, there are many cities for you to explore and have fun. Many new Game modes and new exciting cities will be added continuously.

You can fly, shoot and do many more things in Mud 2. There are also cool levels that feature a giant periodic table with images of the elements or that feature a football stadium. Later on there will be a Multiplayer Mode.

And for those who played Mud 1, sorry that it didn't play well. Now everything is fixed and the game graphics also are much more improved. Thank you for waiting for 30 November. Also a great Thank you to everyone who contributed in a way or the other for this game. ~From Mauritius ‚ù§~

Warning: Some worlds in Mud 2 may not play well on lower-end devices. You will be able to play all cities but if your phone is not too powerful, some cities may lag (NOT ALL).

# Changelog
```
  [Build 2.2.5]

  *Finally Mud 2 is released. First of all, I would like to apologize to everyone who had played the original Mud and who faced all the issues. Everything is fixed now. The Menus have been re-designed, the buttons and text elements have been made bigger, new Soundtracks from NCS have been added in all the game modes and menus. To overcome the issues due to lag, the worlds/cities have been broken down in even smaller worlds/cities. Due to this change, the graphics have been improved. Also, more worlds/cities have been added. Now coming to the fixes in the game modes:

  *UI :All the buttons and text elements have been fixed and placed well. The radar and the minimap are fixed in all the game modes and the minimap can be now toggled on or off.
  *Characters :The Character in the Third Person Controller mode has been made more handsome. The robot and cat in the city of Mud also have been improved. The Cat's name is Mordi by the way. In the First Person Shooter mode, everything is fixed and you can now shoot with 4 different guns. "Gun Cycling" and "Shoot" buttons have been added too. The FLY game mode has been fixed and you can go up or down with the help of buttons. Also, there is a "Boost" button because the character doesn't go fast while flying.
  *Land Vehicles: The "Gear" text has been removed and the "Speed" text has been made bigger. The Tank can Shoot giant bullets. Green Dream was removed.
  *Airplanes A text has been added so that you can keep track of your Altitude helping you to fly better.
  *In the latest update, there is a Camera button in the game modes of Land Vehicles and Airplanes. Touch this button to toggle between the chase camera and the first person view camera. Also, giant invisible walls have been added to the all game modes except in those of the Airplanes, so don't get trolled.
